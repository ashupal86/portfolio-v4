## Where It *Technically* Started 😌

My relationship with computers began in school—not with code, but with **strategic misuse of the computer lab**.

Official purpose: PowerPoint presentations.
Actual usage: Games, random clicking, and pretending we were busy when the teacher walked by.

Surprisingly, this is where I got comfortable with computers. Screens didn’t scare me. Buttons invited curiosity. Breaking things felt… educational. 😅

## Class 12th: When Interest Turned Serious 📚⚙️

In 12th standard, computers stopped being a background character and became the main plot.

* First term: SQL
* Second term: Java
* Timeline: Post-COVID confusion (iykyk)

This was the first time I wasn’t just *studying* something—I was genuinely interested. I wanted to understand how things worked instead of just getting the output.

I learned from everywhere: books, blogs, videos, forums, and random internet threads written by people who sounded both confident and slightly angry.

For the first time, it felt like I had found *my thing*. 👀✨

## My First Program and My First Humbling 😵‍💫

Naturally, I decided to start strong.

I picked **Java GUI with Swing**.

Bad decision.

I tried building a decent UI using a GUI builder tool whose name I’ve intentionally erased from memory. Layouts refused to cooperate, buttons misbehaved, and concepts like classes and event handling teamed up against me.

I spent days on Stack Overflow. Nights too. ☕🌙

Still didn’t get it.

Eventually, I did what every developer does at least once:
I quit.

Not permanently—just emotionally.

## Post-Boards Reality Check

Boards ended and suddenly everyone wanted life decisions.

I thought about JEE, but I knew one thing clearly—I didn’t want to spend an entire year doing only that.

So I chose a private Tier-3 college and made an internal agreement:

College will give me a degree.
The internet will teach me everything else.

Before even starting college, I had already:

* Learned Python to an intermediate level
* Covered basic web technologies

Nothing fancy. Just enough to feel dangerous.

## First Year: The Advice That Actually Worked 🧠

In my first year, I met a senior who said something simple:

Explore as much as you can. You’ll figure it out.

I followed that advice aggressively.

And instead of finding one clear passion, I discovered something unexpected:

I enjoy learning **across domains**, not locking myself into one. 🧩

## Accidentally Becoming a Tech Event Regular 🏃‍♂️💨

That curiosity pushed me into places I didn’t even know existed:

* Tech webinars
* Hackathons
* Hands-on labs
* Events I applied to without fully understanding the agenda

Did my tech stack match? Rarely.
Did that stop me? Not at all.

Frontend, backend, cloud, AI—I showed up anyway.

This didn’t stop after first year.

I kept doing this **till my 3rd year**.

Hackathons, webinars, hands-on labs—again and again.

Over time, these events stacked up into real exposure, not just certificates. I wasn’t chasing wins; I was chasing understanding.

By the time I reached my third year, I had attended **10+ hackathons and webinars**, and learned more from these rooms than I ever expected.

## Why These Events Worked (And College Didn’t Always)

Here’s the honest part.

I paid more attention in these events than I did in most college lectures.

Not because college is useless—but because these sessions don’t just teach you *what* to do.

They make you care.

Nobody spoon-feeds syntax. Instead, they talk about:

* Real-world problems
* Things breaking at the worst possible time
* Decisions that looked smart until production proved otherwise

That kind of learning sticks.

## When I Accidentally Became the Person on Stage 🎤😳

Somewhere along the way, something unexpected happened.

I didn’t just attend events anymore.

I became part of one.

I got the chance to **teach Docker and deployment**—not in a textbook, read-the-slides way, but by breaking things live, explaining why they broke, and fixing them step by step.

That experience did more than add a line to my resume.

It boosted my confidence. 📈

It proved that I actually *understood* what I was learning.

And it unlocked a new realization:

I love teaching—but not the traditional way. 🎯

I never liked classrooms where learning meant memorizing and repeating like a parrot. Making learning **fun**, practical, and curiosity-driven felt natural to me.

If people are engaged, they don’t need to be forced to learn.

## Knowledge Is Easy, Experience Is Not

One thing became clear very early:

Technology isn’t about opinions—it’s about thinking patterns.

These events didn’t just add tools to my stack. They changed how I approach problems, how I debug, and how I stay calm when nothing works.

That shift in mindset matters more than any framework.

## The Part Nobody Finishes 🌀

Once you’re genuinely into tech, you realize something uncomfortable:

You’ll never know enough.

There’s always a better approach, a cleaner solution, a smarter architecture waiting to humble you.

And that’s not discouraging—it’s addictive. 🔁

## Ending on a Truth 🧠🔥

Jack of all trades, master of none — but oftentimes better than master of one.

Because exploration builds perspective.
Perspective builds confidence.

And in tech, confidence comes from one unavoidable process:

The more you fuck around, the more you gonna find out.

That’s not recklessness.
That’s how learning actually happens.
